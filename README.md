HeroinHero v2.0
===============

A meaningful expansion to the timeless classic, Heroin Hero.

On the Web
----------

Does it run on the web? Not yet. But we intend to host it after LAhacks
and we will update our README right here to reflect the URL when we do.

About Our Project
-----------------

This game was built for LAhacks 2014 in Pauley Pavilion. Much of our
project uses the phasor.js library. You can clone the library here:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser.git
```

You can also view useful examples using their library by cloning:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-examples.git
```

Running Our Project on Your Machine
-----------------------------------

Our project is designed to be run in a web browser. It was tested on Google Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.

These code files can be run directly with the following steps:

First, go in the shell and enter these 3 lines:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/lakshmipathyarjun6/HeroinHero_v2.0.git # clone our repo
$ cd HeroinHero_v2.0
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer # launch python webserver
```

Then, in your favorite web browser, type in the url bar:
```
127.0.0.1:8000
```
and press enter. This will launch the game.
