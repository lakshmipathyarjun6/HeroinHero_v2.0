HeroinHero v2.0
===============

A meaningful expansion to the timeless classic, Heroin Hero.

About Our Project
-----------------

This game was built for LAhacks 2014 in Pauley Pavilion. Much of our
project uses the phasor.js library. You can clone the library here:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser.git
```

You can also view useful examples using their library by cloning:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-examples.git
```

Running Our Project
-------------------

Our project is designed to be run in a web browser. It was tested on Google Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.

These code files can be run directly with the following steps:

First, go in the shell:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/lakshmipathyarjun6/HeroinHero_v2.0.git # clone our repo
$ cd HeroinHero_v2.0
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer # launch python webserver
```

Then, in your favorite web browser, type in the url bar '127.0.0.1:8000'
and press enter. This will access the index.html file in the
HeroinHero_v2.0 directory.

On the Web
----------

But does it run on the web? Not yet. But we intend to host it after LAhacks
and we will update our README to reflect the URL when we do.
